"[{\"link\": \"http://reuters.com/article/us-viacom-compensation-idUSKCN0V02NO\\n\", \"content\": \"\\n\\nBOSTON Viacom Inc said on Friday it cut the total pay of its 92-year-old Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone by 85 percent to $2 million last year in light of his \\\"reduced responsibilities\\\" and that it had raised the pay of Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman.In a securities filing, the media company said the total compensation of Dauman rose to $54.2 million for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2015, up from $44.3 million in the previous period, driven by a contract renewal award. The company's shares fell 44 percent during the period.Viacom, whose networks include Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon, has faced ratings challenges, cord-cutting by cable TV consumers, and growing concerns about the health of Redstone, its founder, and his fitness to oversee the company.Even as the company was issuing its annual proxy filing, a California judge ruled on Friday that Redstone could be examined by a doctor hired by his ex-girlfriend in a dispute over his mental competency. Also, a recent lawsuit claims that Viacom and CBS Corp,  where Redstone is also executive chairman, improperly paid millions for Redstone's services even though he was \\\"incapacitated\\\".\\nViacom's filing did not describe how Redstone's responsibilities had been reduced, and a company spokesman said on Friday that he did not have more details.Viacom had outlined some of the pay changes on Jan. 20, but it had not said that Redstone's duties had been decreased or that Dauman would get a pay increase overall. Redstone's new role meant he was no longer eligible to receive a bonus, which was $10 million in the previous fiscal year, Viacom said. Redstone's annual salary rose to $2 million in fiscal 2015 from $1,935,577 the prior year.\\nViacom said in the filing that for fiscal 2015 the total pay of Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley fell to $29.4 million from $35 million in the prior year. Dooley's employment agreement is due  to expire at the end of this year, which has raised questions about whether he will stay with the company.CEO Dauman's pay last year included a stock award worth $17 million tied to the renewal of his contract. Dauman's bonus was $14 million, down from $20 million the prior year, while Dooley's bonus was $11.2 million, down from $16 million in the prior year.\\nViacom said both executives had requested that their bonus payments be reduced so money could be shifted to increase incentive payments at the company's operating units. While Redstone controls a supermajority of the company's Class A voting shares through his holding company, National Amusements, his health situation and the company's high executive pay have led to questions about its corporate governance.As expected, Friday's filing included a shareholder proposal calling for the company to recapitalize itself so that all shares would have an equal vote. Viacom said it opposes the measure because its current capital structure protects it from disruptive activist challenges and that Redstone's holding company would vote against it, ensuring it cannot pass.

He controls Viacom and CBS Corp, although his role at the companies has grown less visible.Viacom cut Redstone's pay 85 percent to $2 million last year, the company said in a securities filing on Friday, citing \\\"reduced responsibilities,\\\"Geriatric psychiatrist Stephen Read will conduct the court-ordered mental examination within the next 10 days, said Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Redstone's former girlfriend Manuela Herzer.Redstone\\u2019s attorneys have not indicated whether they will appeal, a development that could affect the schedule. They have argued that Herzer has filed the suit for financial gain.Read may interview Redstone for up to an hour, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan said in his ruling. Redstone's attorneys acknowledge he has a speech impairment, and Cowan wrote that the executive's nurses and speech therapists may be present during the exam.Herzer and her attorneys cannot be present.\\nHerzer's lawsuit filed in November said that Redstone had chosen her to make healthcare decisions for him in case he was not able to. It claimed the billionaire was mentally incompetent when he replaced her as his designated healthcare agent on Oct. 16 with Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman.Read, in a declaration filed in November on behalf of Herzer, said he believed Redstone lacked the mental capacity to make that change. He cited testimony from Herzer and other witnesses but he had not examined Redstone in person.Redstone's primary physician, Dr. Richard Gold, told the court Redstone was fully aware of what he was doing at the time.Gold was deposed by Herzer's attorneys this month. The judge said in his ruling called Gold's deposition testimony \\\"equivocal\\\" and \\\"inconsistent\\\" with his declaration.\\nGold, who visits Redstone two or three times a week, also testified that \\\"he could not understand Redstone half the time,\\\" Cowan wrote. The new exam can take place at either Redstone's home or the doctor's office if Redstone prefers, Cowan said.Redstone's advance healthcare directive makes Gold responsible for gauging whether he can manage his own care, court filings show. But the judge said Gold testified that he did not know it was his responsibility. The judge said Gold also testified that he had \\\"no experience\\\" making such decisions.Gold said he believed Redstone could withstand a short mental exam, Cowan said in the ruling.\\nStill, Cowan rejected a request by Herzer's lawyers to depose Redstone. \\\"We are gratified that the Court continues to reject Ms. Herzer's increasingly desperate and disingenuous attempts to depose Mr. Redstone,\\\" Gabrielle Vidal, an attorney for Redstone, said in a statement.Redstone's lawyers said Herzer is pursuing a \\\"personal financial agenda.\\\" They told the judge that at the same time Herzer was removed as health care agent, Redstone had also revoked a part of his estate plan which had left Herzer \\\"a very significant sum of money,\\\" according to the ruling. Cowan said it was \\\"at least conceivable\\\" that Herzer might care about Redstone's medical care even if she had a financial interest.Redstone \\\"has not yet addressed the counter-intuitive notion as to why someone would prefer to have a person across the country care for one's medical needs in time of emergency,\\\" Cowan added. Dauman is based in New York, while Redstone lives in California.Lawyers for Redstone have filed a motion to dismiss the case. A hearing on that motion was postponed until Feb. 29.
